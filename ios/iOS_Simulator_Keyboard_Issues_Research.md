# iOS Simulator Keyboard Not Showing - Research Summary

## Overview
The iOS simulator keyboard not showing is a common issue in React Native development. This is typically a **simulator-specific issue** and does not affect real iOS devices.

## Root Cause
The primary cause is that the iOS simulator has the hardware keyboard connected by default, which prevents the software keyboard from appearing automatically.

## Solutions

### 1. Quick Fix with Keyboard Shortcuts (Recommended)
- **Toggle Software Keyboard**: `Cmd + K`
- **Disconnect Hardware Keyboard**: `Shift + Cmd + K`

### 2. Menu Navigation Method
Navigate to: **Hardware → Keyboard → Uncheck "Connect Hardware Keyboard"**

Note: In some Xcode versions, this might be under **I/O → Keyboard → Connect Hardware Keyboard**

### 3. Persistent Solution
1. Click on the iOS simulator
2. Press `Cmd + K` to show the keyboard
3. After this, the keyboard should appear every time you tap on a TextInput

## Known Issues in Your Project

### Current TextInput Usage
Based on the codebase analysis:
- No `autoFocus` props are being used in TextInput components
- TextInput components are used in multiple screens:
  - `/src/screens/SearchScreen.tsx`
  - `/src/screens/auth/SignInScreen.tsx`
  - `/src/screens/auth/SignUpScreen.tsx`
  - `/src/components/common/AutocompleteInput.tsx`
  - And several other screens

### Potential Issues with autoFocus
If you plan to use `autoFocus` in the future, be aware:
1. `autoFocus` may not trigger the keyboard in simulators when hardware keyboard is connected
2. Workaround for autoFocus:
   ```javascript
   const inputRef = React.useRef();
   useEffect(() => {
     setTimeout(() => inputRef.current?.focus(), 100);
   }, []);
   ```

## Recent Issues (2024)
- iOS 18+ on iPad has reported issues with keyboard not opening in React Native 0.73.2
- Modal components may require special handling for keyboard focus

## Best Practices
1. Always test with software keyboard enabled in simulator
2. Use `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"` on ScrollView components containing TextInputs
3. For production testing, always verify on real devices
4. Consider adding a note in your README about this simulator-specific issue

## Developer Tips
1. Add this to your project documentation for new developers
2. Consider creating a setup script that reminds developers to disconnect hardware keyboard
3. If the issue persists after trying these solutions, check for:
   - Conflicting keyboard management libraries
   - Custom keyboard handling code
   - Issues with navigation libraries (react-navigation)

## Verification Steps
1. Open iOS Simulator
2. Use `Shift + Cmd + K` to disconnect hardware keyboard
3. Tap on any TextInput field
4. Software keyboard should now appear
5. Use `Cmd + K` to toggle keyboard visibility as needed

This is a development environment issue only and will not affect your app users on real devices.
