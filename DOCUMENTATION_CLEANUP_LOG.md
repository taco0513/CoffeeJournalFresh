- To: "Navigation: Simple state-based navigation (no external navigation library)"

#### docs/05-ARCHITECTURE.md

- To: "├── navigation/          # Simple state-based navigation"

- Changed: "- **React Navigation**: 6.x with type safety"
- To: "- **Simple Navigation**: State-based navigation (no external navigation library)"

- Changed: "- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket connections"
- To: "- **Real-time Features**: Future consideration"

#### PRD.md
- Changed: "- **Navigation**: React Navigation"
- To: "- **Navigation**: Simple state-based navigation (no external navigation library)"

#### TECH-STACK.md
- Replaced entire React Navigation section with Simple State-Based Navigation section

- Changed: `claude "React Navigation으로 6개 화면 네비게이션 설정해줘"`
- To: `claude "Simple state-based navigation으로 6개 화면 네비게이션 설정해줘"`

## Summary

All documentation has been updated to accurately reflect:
1. **No web version** - This is an iOS-first, Android-second mobile app only
2. **No React Navigation** - Using simple state-based navigation due to stability issues
3. **Consistent project focus** - All contradictory information has been removed

The documentation now provides clear, consistent guidance that will prevent future confusion or hallucination about the project's scope and technical implementation.
