## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Coffee Info** → Enter comprehensive coffee details (cafe, roastery, name, origin, variety, altitude, process, roast level, temperature)
2. **Photo Upload** → OCR-ready photo upload for automatic data extraction
3. **Roaster Notes** → Input roaster's flavor descriptions
4. **Flavor Selection** → 4-level hierarchical flavor selection
5. **Sensory Evaluation** → Rate body, acidity, sweetness, finish, mouthfeel
6. **Results** → View match score, community comparison, and similar coffees

## 🎯 Match Algorithm

- **Flavor Matching (60%)**: Compares roaster notes with user selections
- **Sensory Matching (40%)**: Evaluates sensory attribute alignment
- **Score Range**: 0-100% matching accuracy
- **Bilingual Processing**: Supports Korean and English terms

## 📊 Key Metrics

- **Match Score**: Overall tasting accuracy
- **Flavor Score**: Flavor profile matching
- **Sensory Score**: Sensory attribute alignment
- **Historical Tracking**: View past tasting performance

## 🔧 Development

This project uses:
- React Native 0.80.1
- React 19.1.0
- TypeScript for type safety
- Zustand for state management
- Realm for local data persistence
- Supabase for cloud sync and data collection
