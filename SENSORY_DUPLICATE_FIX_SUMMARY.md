# Sensory Evaluation Duplicate Fix Summary

## Issue
The sensory evaluation feature was creating duplicate selections when users picked expressions across different categories. The same expression could be selected multiple times, appearing as duplicates in the selected list.

## Root Causes
1. **Data Structure Mismatch**: CompactSensoryEvaluation uses `expression.id` while the store uses `expressionId`
2. **No Store-Level Deduplication**: The store was accepting duplicate expressions without validation
3. **Ineffective UI Deduplication**: Multiple deduplication attempts in the UI layer were not working properly
4. **Over-Complex Logic**: The global selection check was preventing valid selections in different categories

## Solution Applied

### 1. Store-Level Deduplication (tastingStore.ts)
Added proper deduplication logic in `setSelectedSensoryExpressions`:
```typescript
setSelectedSensoryExpressions: (expressions) => {
  // Deduplicate based on unique expression ID (expressionId)
  const seen = new Set<string>();
  const deduped = expressions.filter(expr => {
    if (seen.has(expr.expressionId)) {
      return false;
    }
    seen.add(expr.expressionId);
    return true;
  });
  
  set(() => ({
    selectedSensoryExpressions: deduped,
  }));
},
```

### 2. Simplified Data Transformation (SensoryEvaluationScreen.tsx)
Removed ineffective deduplication attempts and simplified the conversion:
```typescript
const handleExpressionChange = useCallback((expressions) => {
  const converted = expressions.map(item => ({
    categoryId: item.categoryId,
    expressionId: item.expression.id,
    korean: item.expression.korean,
    english: item.expression.english,
    emoji: item.expression.emoji,
    intensity: 3,
    selected: true,
  }));
  
  setSelectedSensoryExpressions(converted);
}, [setSelectedSensoryExpressions]);
```

### 3. Cleaned Up UI Logic (CompactSensoryEvaluation.tsx)
- Removed the global selection check that was preventing valid selections
- Simplified the selection logic to only check within the current category
- Removed unnecessary UI states and styles for globally selected items
- Made the component focus on single-category selection limits only

### 4. Simplified Display Logic
Removed redundant deduplication in the display layer since the store now handles it properly.

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner Code**: Removed ~50 lines of ineffective deduplication code
2. **Better Performance**: Single deduplication point instead of multiple attempts
3. **Correct Behavior**: Users can now select expressions properly without duplicates
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns - store handles data integrity

## Testing
The app is now running successfully with these changes. Users should be able to:
- Select up to 3 expressions per category
- Not see duplicates in their selection
- Have a smooth, predictable selection experience
