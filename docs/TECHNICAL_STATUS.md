## Development Commands
```bash
# Run iOS
npm start
npx react-native run-ios

# Build for release
cd ios && xcodebuild -workspace CupNote.xcworkspace -scheme CupNote -configuration Release

# Development debugging (in simulator console)
clearDraftStorage()        # Clear problematic draft data
inspectDraftStorage()      # Debug draft storage issues
bridgeDebugger.printRecentCalls()  # Debug bridge errors
```

## Package Manager Strategy
- **Primary**: npm (for stability, React Native compatibility, team consistency)
- **Secondary**: Bun (for quick scripts, TypeScript execution, testing packages)
- **Hybrid Approach**: Use npm for dependencies/builds, Bun for development utilities
