## ⚙️ Technical Analysis

### TypeScript Compilation Status

#### 🚨 **Critical Issues (271 errors)**

**Tamagui Configuration (High Priority)**
```typescript
// tamagui.config.ts issues
error TS7022: 'config' implicitly has type 'any'
error TS2456: Type alias 'AppConfig' circularly references itself
error TS2310: Type 'TamaguiCustomConfig' recursively references itself
```

**Cross-Market Testing Components**
```typescript
// MarketConfigurationTester.tsx - 15 errors
- Property 'systemIndigo' does not exist on HIGColors
- Cannot find name 'rosters'. Did you mean 'roasters'?
- Type mismatches in TestResult interfaces
```

**Legacy Style References**
```typescript
// Multiple files using deprecated properties
- HIGColors.systemIndigo (doesn't exist)
- HIGConstants.FONT_SIZE_TITLE1 (should be FONT_SIZE_TITLE)
- HIGColors.separator (not available)
```

**Mock Data Type Issues**
```typescript
// Interfaces not matching implementations
- TastePattern missing properties
- GrowthMetrics incomplete
- MasteryLevel incorrect structure
```

### Navigation Architecture

#### ✅ **Current Status: Excellent**
```typescript
// AppNavigator.tsx - All Tamagui imports
import {
  HomeScreen,
  ModeSelectionScreen,
  // ... 31 screens total
} from '../screens-tamagui';

// Development auto-login enabled
if (__DEV__ && !isAuthenticated) {
  setTestUser();
}
```

**Navigation Flow Analysis**:
- ✅ **Main Tabs**: Home, Journal, History, Profile
- ✅ **Tasting Flow**: 7-step guided experience
- ✅ **Admin Stack**: Management interface (for admin users)
- ✅ **Profile Stack**: 12 sub-screens with full functionality
- ✅ **Authentication**: Sign-in/sign-up flow
