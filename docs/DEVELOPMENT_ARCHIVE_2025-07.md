#### Future Enhancements
8. **Smart Suggestions**: AI-powered complementary flavor recommendations
9. **Batch Selection Mode**: Power user features (select all/invert/clear)
10. **Tablet Optimization**: Responsive design for larger screens

### UI Pattern References
- **Netflix-style**: Vertical categories with horizontal subcategory scrolling
- **Material Design Chips**: Filter chip patterns with selection states
- **E-commerce Filters**: Amazon/eBay style category browsing
- **Coffee App Examples**: Starbucks customization, Blue Bottle flavor notes

## TypeScript Fix Session (2025-07-23)
### Summary
Partially fixed TypeScript errors: 319 → 152 errors (52% reduction)

### Key Fixes Applied:
1. **FlavorPath Import Errors**: Fixed imports to use '../types/tasting' instead of stores
2. **Temperature Type Mismatch**: Changed "ice" to "cold" to match 'hot' | 'cold' type
3. **Implicit Any Types**: Added type annotations for arrays, function parameters, object indexing
4. **Module Resolution**: Fixed supabase imports to use '../supabase/client'
5. **Navigation Type Errors**: Fixed navigation calls, commented out unimplemented screens
6. **Property Access Errors**: Added type assertions for dynamic property access

### Remaining Issues (152 errors):
- Missing npm packages (react-native-touch-id, react-native-keychain, crypto-js, @react-native-firebase/auth)
- Services moved to feature_backlog that are still referenced
- Complex type mismatches requiring deeper refactoring

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/CameraModal.tsx`: Fixed OCRService imports
- `src/hooks/usePersonalTaste.ts`: Updated to use mock data for removed services
- `src/types/personalTaste.ts`: Added placeholder types for backlogged features
- Multiple screens: Fixed navigation types, property access, and type annotations
- Feature backlog files: Added missing type annotations

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Configuration
### Context7 MCP Server (2025-07-23)
- **Status**: ✅ Configured and Active
- **Purpose**: Provides up-to-date documentation and code examples for libraries
- **Auto-Activation**: ALWAYS ACTIVE for all development tasks
- **Version**: v1.0.14
- **Configuration**: Added to `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Benefits**: Real-time library docs, version-aware examples, no outdated APIs

### Serena MCP Server (2025-07-23)
- **Status**: ✅ Configured and Active
- **Purpose**: Semantic code analysis and editing using Language Server Protocol (LSP)
- **Features**: Symbol-level code navigation, refactoring, multi-language support
- **Benefits**: Precise code modifications, dependency analysis, safe refactoring
- **Use Cases**: Achievement UI implementation, type consistency, code cleanup

### Future MCP Considerations
- **Claude Flow**: Powerful hive-mind AI orchestration system with 87 tools
  - Status: Alpha version, too complex for current MVP stage
  - Reconsider for: Post-MVP Phase 2-4 features, large-scale refactoring
  - Repository: https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow

## Package Manager Strategy
- **Primary**: npm (for stability, React Native compatibility, team consistency)
- **Secondary**: Bun (for quick scripts, TypeScript execution, testing packages)
- **Hybrid Approach**: Use npm for dependencies/builds, Bun for development utilities
