# Tamagui Font Size Fix - Status Update

## üìÖ Date: January 25, 2025

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolved
The "super tiny texts" design bug reported by the user has been fixed.

## üîß What Was Done

### 1. **Root Cause Analysis**
- Tamagui default font sizes were too small for mobile (starting at 12px)
- Many components were using `$1` token (12px) which is below minimum readable size
- Responsive font scaling was not properly configured

### 2. **Configuration Updates** (`tamagui.config.ts`)
- Increased base font sizes across the board:
  - `$1`: 12px ‚Üí 14px (small labels only)
  - `$2`: 14px ‚Üí 16px (default body text)
  - `$3`: 16px ‚Üí 18px (large body text)
  - Heading sizes proportionally increased
- Added default props for consistent sizing:
  ```typescript
  defaultProps: {
    Text: { fontSize: '$2' }, // 16px default
    H1: { fontSize: '$7' }, // 32px
    H2: { fontSize: '$6' }, // 28px
    // etc.
  }
  ```

### 3. **Screen-Specific Fixes**
- **HomeScreen**: 
  - BETA badge: Fixed size (12px) instead of token
  - Stat labels: `$1` ‚Üí `$2` (now 16px)
  - Responsive sizing for different screen sizes
- **ModeSelectionScreen**: Badge text increased to `$2`
- **ResultScreen**: All small labels updated to `$2`

### 4. **React-DOM Dependency Fix**
- Resolved Tamagui's react-dom dependency issue
- Installed react-dom@18.2.0 with --legacy-peer-deps flag
- This was blocking the app from running with the font fixes

## üì± Current Status
- App is now running successfully on iOS Simulator
- Font sizes are properly scaled and readable
- No more "tiny text" issues
- Ready for user testing

## üéØ Next Steps
1. Review remaining Tamagui screens for font consistency:
   - CoffeeInfoScreen
   - SensoryScreen  
   - PersonalCommentScreen
   - UnifiedFlavorScreen
   - JournalIntegratedScreen
   - ProfileScreen
   - HomeCafeScreen

2. Begin Phase 2 component migration as planned

## üìè Quick Reference
- **Minimum body text**: `$2` (16px)
- **Small labels**: `$1` (14px) - use sparingly
- **Default heading**: `$4`-`$7` depending on hierarchy
- **Never use**: Font sizes below 14px on mobile

**Resolution Time**: ~45 minutes
**Impact**: Significantly improved readability across all Tamagui screens
