## 🔌 Integration Points

### **Tasting Flow Integration**
```tsx
// In TastingSubmissionHandler
const handleTastingSubmit = async (tastingData) => {
  // Existing tasting logic...
  
  // Achievement check
  const unlockedAchievements = await AchievementSystem.checkUserAchievements(
    userId,
    { type: 'tasting', data: tastingData, timestamp: new Date() }
  );
  
  if (unlockedAchievements.length > 0) {
    // Show achievement notification
    showAchievementNotification(unlockedAchievements);
  }
};
```

### **Profile Screen Integration**
```tsx
// Achievement summary section
const ProfileAchievementsSummary = () => {
  const { achievements, totalPoints, nextAchievement } = useAchievements();
  
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => navigateToAchievements()}>
      <AchievementSummaryCard 
        unlockedCount={achievements.filter(a => a.unlockedAt).length}
        totalPoints={totalPoints}
        nextAchievement={nextAchievement}
      />
    </TouchableOpacity>
  );
};
```
