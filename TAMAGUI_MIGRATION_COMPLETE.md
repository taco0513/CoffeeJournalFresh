- **Component Compatibility**: Verified Tamagui screens work with existing React Native components
- **No Conflicts**: No component naming conflicts between Tamagui and original versions

### 📊 Migration Statistics

**Screens Migrated to Tamagui**: 9 core screens
- ✅ HomeScreen (core app entry)
- ✅ ModeSelectionScreen (tasting mode selection) 
- ✅ CoffeeInfoScreen (coffee details entry)
- ✅ SensoryScreen (Korean sensory evaluation)
- ✅ PersonalCommentScreen (personal notes)
- ✅ ResultScreen (tasting results display)
- ✅ HomeCafeScreen (home brewing mode)
- ✅ UnifiedFlavorScreen (flavor selection)
- ✅ JournalIntegratedScreen (history and stats)
- ✅ ProfileScreen (user profile and settings)

**Navigation Integration**: 100% complete
- All core tasting flow uses Tamagui screens
- Clean import organization
- Eliminated duplicate screen references
- Maintained backward compatibility

**Performance Benefits**:
- 🚀 **Faster Animations**: Native spring animations in Tamagui
- 🎨 **Better Theming**: Coffee-themed design tokens
- 📱 **Consistent UI**: Unified design system across screens  
- ⚡ **Bundle Optimization**: Tree-shaking and static extraction

### 🎨 Design System Integration

**Coffee-Themed Tokens**:
```typescript
colors: {
  espresso: '#3E2723',    // Dark coffee brown
  latte: '#D7CCC8',       // Light coffee cream  
  foam: '#EFEBE9',        // Milk foam white
  bean: '#6F4E37',        // Coffee bean brown
  cupBlue: '#2196F3',     // Brand primary
  acidity: '#FF9800',     // Sensory categories
  sweetness: '#E91E63',
  body: '#9C27B0',
  // ... more semantic colors
}
```

**Animation System**:
- `bouncy` - Interactive elements with spring damping
- `lazy` - Smooth content transitions
- `quick` - Fast button feedback

**Typography**:
- Inter font family optimized for coffee app readability
- Consistent sizing scale across all screens

### 📂 File Organization
